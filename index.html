    <h3>Cities lived in.</h3>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX. Went to university in Winter Park Florida for a few years. <br>
        back to Texas afterwards and got a job in Plano. Then moved to Dallas before joining the Air Force. <br>
        technical training at Keesler got station at Whiteman AFB in Missouri. Joined the Space Force and <br>
        then got sent to Vandenberg SFB in California.

    <h3>Top 3 cities I want to visit</h3>
    <p>
        I became interested in Japanes culture after being exposed to it through anime I came across on VHS tapes. <br>
        Tokyo apeals to me with its walk-ability and small back alleys filled with small bars and food shops.<br>
        I believe Berlin would be awesome to see. I enjoy electronic dance music and there is a large scene <br>
        of clubs as well as stores with vinyle records. I studied art history at a university and think that <br>
        Venis would be amaizing to see with all the history it has along with the surounding areas.
